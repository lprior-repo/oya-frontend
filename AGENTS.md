## Quick Reference

| Area | Rule |
|------|------|
| **Workspace** | specs, tests, src visible; scenarios-vault hidden |
| **State** | `use_signal` / `use_store`, NEVER `use_state` |
| **Build** | Moon only, `moon run :ci --force` |
| **Code Search** | Codanna MCP tools ONLY |
| **Quality** | Hidden scenarios, sanitized feedback |

## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking. Do NOT use markdown TODOs, task lists, or other tracking methods.

### Why bd?

- Dependency-aware: Track blockers and relationships between issues
- Git-friendly: Dolt-powered version control with native sync
- Agent-optimized: JSON output, ready work detection, discovered-from links
- Prevents duplicate tracking systems and confusion

### Quick Start

**Check for ready work:**

```bash
bd ready --json
```

**Create new issues:**

```bash
bd create "Issue title" --description="Detailed context" -t bug|feature|task -p 0-4 --json
bd create "Issue title" --description="What this issue is about" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:bd-123 --json
```

**Claim and update:**

```bash
bd update <id> --claim --json
bd update bd-42 --priority 1 --json
```

**Complete work:**

```bash
bd close bd-42 --reason "Completed" --json
```

### Issue Types

- `bug` - Something broken
- `feature` - New functionality
- `task` - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)
- `epic` - Large feature with subtasks
- `chore` - Maintenance (dependencies, tooling)

### Priorities

- `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)
- `1` - High (major features, important bugs)
- `2` - Medium (default, nice-to-have)
- `3` - Low (polish, optimization)
- `4` - Backlog (future ideas)

### Workflow for AI Agents

1. **Check ready work**: `bd ready` shows unblocked issues
2. **Claim your task atomically**: `bd update <id> --claim`
3. **Work on it**: Implement, test, document
4. **Discover new work?** Create linked issue:
   - `bd create "Found bug" --description="Details about what was found" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<parent-id>`
5. **Complete**: `bd close <id> --reason "Done"`

### Auto-Sync

bd automatically syncs via Dolt:

- Each write auto-commits to Dolt history
- Use `bd dolt push`/`bd dolt pull` for remote sync
- No manual export/import needed!

### Important Rules

- ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking
- ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use
- ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies
- ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking "what should I work on?"
- ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists
- ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers
- ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems

For more details, see README.md and docs/QUICKSTART.md.

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

## Restate Integration

OYA-Frontend hooks into Restate via two HTTP API layers:

### Restate Server Setup

**Prerequisites**: Download and install Restate v1.6.2+ from <https://github.com/restatedev/restate/releases>

```bash
# Download and extract
curl -L "https://restate.gateway.scarf.sh/v1.6.2/restate-server-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.xz" -o restate.tar.xz
tar -xJf restate.tar.xz
cp restate-server-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/restate-server ~/bin/

# Start Restate in dev mode (single-node, auto-provisioning)
rm -rf /tmp/restate-data && mkdir -p /tmp/restate-data
restate-server --base-dir /tmp/restate-data --no-logo --auto-provision=true &
sleep 5
```

**Ports**:
| Port | Purpose | API Path |
|------|---------|----------|
| 8080 | HTTP Ingress (service invocation) | `/{service}/{handler}`, `/{object}/{key}/{handler}`, `/{workflow}/{id}/run` |
| 9070 | Admin API (introspection) | `/query`, `/deployments`, `/services`, `/invocations/{id}/*` |

### Admin API (Port 9070)

Built in `src/restate_client/`. All requests require `Accept: application/json` and `Content-Type: application/json` headers.

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `POST` | `/query` | SQL queries against `sys_invocation`, `sys_journal`, `sys_service`, `sys_deployment`, `sys_promise` tables |
| `GET` | `/deployments` | List registered deployments |
| `GET` | `/services` | List registered services |
| `PATCH` | `/invocations/{id}/cancel` | Cancel an invocation |
| `PATCH` | `/invocations/{id}/kill` | Kill an invocation |
| `PATCH` | `/invocations/{id}/pause` | Pause an invocation |
| `PATCH` | `/invocations/{id}/resume` | Resume a paused invocation |
| `DELETE` | `/invocations/{id}` | Purge an invocation |

**Example query**:
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:9070/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "SELECT * FROM sys_invocation LIMIT 5"}'
```

### Ingress API (Port 8080)

Built in `src/graph/execution_runtime/service_calls.rs`. Used to invoke services:

| Node Type | HTTP Pattern |
|-----------|--------------|
| `service-call` | `POST {ingress}/{service}/{endpoint}` |
| `object-call` | `POST {ingress}/{object}/{key}/{handler}` |
| `workflow-call` | `POST {ingress}/{workflow}/{uuid}/run` |

### Frontend State Sync

The Dioxus frontend syncs with Restate via a poll-based architecture:

```
Restate Admin (:9070)
    │ POST /query (SQL)
    ▼
InvocationPoller (src/restate_sync/poller.rs)
    │ state machine: Initial → Tracking(HashMap<ID, Invocation>)
    ▼
use_restate_sync() hook (src/hooks/use_restate_sync.rs)
    │ Dioxus use_future polling loop (default 2000ms)
    ▼
RestateSyncHandle (Dioxus Context)
    ▼
UI Panels (src/ui/restate/)
```

### Running Tests Against Live Restate

```bash
# 1. Ensure Restate is running
curl -s http://localhost:9070/deployments  # Should return {"deployments":[]}
curl -s http://localhost:8080/              # Should return service error (not connection error)

# 2. Run the E2E test suite
moon run :ci --force

# 3. Or run the Restate-specific E2E test
./e2e/agent_restate.sh http://localhost:8084
```

### Troubleshooting

**Port already in use**:
```bash
lsof -i :8080  # Find process
kill -9 <PID>  # Kill it
```

**Restate won't start (address in use)**:
```bash
# Check for existing restate processes
ps aux | grep restate
# Kill all restate processes and retry
pkill -9 restate-server
```

**Admin API returns binary (protobuf)**:
- Add `Accept: application/json` header to requests
- Restate defaults to protobuf; JSON is opt-in

### E2E Test Notes

**Dioxus Version**: Project now uses `dioxus = "0.7.5"` (aligned with `dx` CLI 0.7.5)

**Current Status**:
- ✅ Restate integration works at code level (901 tests pass)
- ✅ Admin API (9070) verified working  
- ✅ Ingress API (8080) verified working
- ✅ Clippy passes
- ⚠️ E2E browser tests have WASM initialization issues in headless Chrome

**E2E Browser Test Issue**: The WASM app partially renders ("Hello from Oya!" visible) but the full React-like app doesn't initialize. The "Your app is being rebuilt" message indicates Dioxus's hot-reload state isn't resolving.

**Running Tests**:
```bash
# Run unit/integration tests (all pass except 5 that expect "no server")
moon run :test

# Run clippy (passes)
moon run :clippy

# Run E2E (may fail due to WASM init in headless Chrome)
moon run :ci --force
```
